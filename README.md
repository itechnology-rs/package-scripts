# Continuum Package Scripts

These are the package config scripts we use to build the runtimes available in
Continuum.

**NOTE: this repository is deprecated in favor of [continuum-package-scripts](https://github.com/apcera/continuum-package-scripts), which is open source.

Using these definitions can be done through the use of APC:

```console
$ apc package build runtimes/go-1.3.conf
```

This will use the package definition to generate a build script, upload that to
Continuum, and have it generate the package and store the results as the
package's data.
